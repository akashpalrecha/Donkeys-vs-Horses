# Donkeys-vs-horses-classifier
This repo contains a simple Resnet18 classifier (trained on a Macbook without a GPU) to differentiate Horses from Donkeys (because why not?). There are two different models :

1. A very normal, everyday binary classification model
2. A singe channel in every image is randomly ignored while training and testing the model.

Thed data for this project was scraped from Google Images
